Module 8: Mapping and Hash Tables
    - Key must always be unique
    - Python has dictionary data structure to hold key-value pairs
    - To map keys, hash functions is used to generate the index location
    - Hash collision -> hash function generate the same code(hash function) for used keys
    - Collision Handling Scheme
        - Conceptualize buckets
        - Worst time complexity to search for the bucket is O(1)
        - Time to search a key in bucket is O(n) time complexity 
        - Open addressing - Linear proving
            - If location occupied, place at next location and repeat till one is empty
            - Requires additional implentation to search for existing key
            - Accessing cell array is analogous to probing the bucket to find its content
        - Load factor = n/N or n items of bucket array in capacity N
            - Preferably below 1

Module 9: Trees
    - Definitions
        - Root, Edge, Path, Parent, Children, Siblings
        - Descendent, ancestor, leaf node, subtree, degree of node, degree of tree
            - Descendent: all nodes below and related to node
            - Leaf nodes: nodes with no children 
            - Degree of node: Number of nodes children
            - Degree of tree: Total number of nodes in tree
    - Binary Search trees
        - All nodes have at most 2 children (left and right)
            - Smaller always on left
            - Larger always on right
        - Balanced tree
            - O(logn) time complexity
        - Imbalanced tree
            - O(n) time complexity
        - Search max()
            - Rightmost element
        - Search min()
            - Leftmost element
        - Predecessor
            - Largest item in the left subtree
        - Successor
            - Smallest item in the right subtree
    - Tree traversal approach
        - Preorder: Root -> Left -> Right
        - Postorder: Left -> Right -> Root
        - Inorder: Left -> Root -> Right (returns elements in order)
    - Determine if tree is balanced, balance factgor
        - Calculate max(left childs height, right childs height) + 1
        - Height of NULL node is -1
        - Balance factor: height (left) - height (right)
            - Negative is right-heavy so rotate left
            - Positive is left-heavy so rotate right
            - Left-right heavy
                - Rotate left first, then rotate right
            - Right-left heavy
                - Rotate right, rotate left
        - Balanced trees are AVL trees

Priority Queues
    - Elements are dequeued based on their priority
    - Stores a collection of items in a (key, value) pair
        - key defines priority
        - value is the actual data
    - highest priority element is the one to come out first
    - Heaps are data structures that are used to implement priority queues (ADT)
        - Max heap -> highest priotiy element has the maximum value
        - Min heap -> vice versa

Shortest Path Problem
    -Dijkstra's Algorithm
        - It can handle positive edge weights
        - It can find the shortest path in a G(V, E) graph from a vertex u to v, alongside constructing a
        shorted path tree as well
        - Solves using the greedy approach 
        - During every iteration, it searches for the minimum distance to the next vertex
            if D[u] + e(u, v) < D[v]:
                D[v] = D[u] + e(u, v)
                v.predecessor = u

Minimum Spanning Tree
    - Given an undirected graph G with weighted edges, a minumum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the edges in the graph 
    which:
        - connects all vertices together
        - have no cycles
        - include edges with minimum weight only
    - Maintain a priority queue (PQ) of edges
    - Start algorithm from any vertex V
        - mark V as visited
        - iterate over all edges of V and add them to PQ
    - while PQ is not empty and MST has not been formed (total edges = V-1)
        - dequeue the next cheapest edge for PQ
        - if the dequeued edge is outdated (i.e., destination vertex is already visited), skip and poll again
        - mark the curent vertex V as visited and add the edge to MST
        - Add V's edges to PQ

Module 9: Trees
    - Tree is an abstract data type that stores elements hierarchically
    - Non-linear data structure, relationship between objects/data are:
        - NOT defined as "before and after" relationship
        - Defined as "above and below" relationship
        - Examples:
            - Organizational charts, file systems
        - Each element in a tree has a parent element and zero.more children elements, 
          except the first/top element which is called the root. 
    - Termonology:
        - Root: Highest-most node without parent
        - Edge: Connection between two nodes to show relationship between them
        - Path: A path is an orderd list of nodes connected by edges
        - Parent:
        - Descendant: All nodes for which there is a path from x (child, grandchild, etc)
        - Ancestor: Opposite of descendent (parent, grandparent)
        - Leaf Node: last node in the tree, or nodes with no children
        - Subtree: A set of nodes and edges comprised of a parent and 
        - Height: number of edges in the longest path from the node x to a leaf
        - Depth/level: Number od edges in path from root to x
        - Degree of node: The number of the node's children
        - In a tree, there must only be a single path from the root node to any other node
    - Trees as Lists
        - Tree can be defined recursively as a root with zero or more children
            - Each child can be a subtree
        - T = ['C', 
                  ['A',
                      ['P', 'N']
                  ]
    - ADT 
        - __init__(L): initializes a new tree with data, children (list) and parent
        - add_child(): 
        - get_level():
        - __str__():
    - Binary Search Trees
        - Data structures to organize data efficiently
        - Every node in the tree can have at most 2 children (left and right child)
            - Left child is amller than the parent node
            - Right child is greater than the parent node
        - New data is placed in sorted order so that the search and other operations can use the
          princible of binary search with O(logn) running time
        - We can access the root node exclusively as the same we can access head node of linked list
        - Inserting element would take O(logN) time complexity 
        - Balanced tree (left and right nodes contain approx. same number of children)
            - operations are O(logN)
        - Imbalanced tree (number of children on both sides differ significantly)
            - operations O(N) time complexity 
        - Operations:
            - insert
            - search (min/max)
            - delete
            - traverse
        - Implementation:
            - Create node class
                - Actual data
                - Parent node
                - Left child
                - Right child
            - Operations:
                - Insert
                    - Add root node if it does not exist
                    - Chec, if the new element is greater/smaller than current parent
                    - If left/right child does not exist, add node to correct side
                    - If child node exists, recursively execute steps 2 and 3

Hash Tables
    - Collision Handling Schemes Separate Chaining
        - Have each bucket M[j] store its own container to carry multile (k, v) items
            - M is the array of buckets
            - j is the location of jth bucket
        - h(k) = j -> hash code
        - Implementation
            1. Create a HashTale of size 10
            2. Create 10 buckets (bucket array) each containing secondary structure (ListMapping)
            3. Putting a key-value pair in the bucket
                - Get the bucket first
                    - Generate a hash function for the key -> using Python's built-in hash function
                    - Take modulo with the size of a hash table to calculate jth index (bucket location)
                    - Return jth bucket
                - Put the key_value pair in the jth bucket (put method)
            4. Retrieving a value
                - Get the bucket (using get method) and return the value associated with the key
        - Time Complexity
            - Time to search for bucket is O(1)
            - Locating element in bucket is O(n)
        - A ratio lamda = n/N is called "Load Factor"
            - "n" items of map in a bucket array capacity of "N"
            - Bounded by a small constant (preferably below 1)
            - Example:
                - n = 15
                - N = 10
                - lamda = 1.5 therefore collision 
        - Dynamic resizing - Double the size of the hash table when load factor increases beyond 1
            - Implement a method to double the size of hash table
                - Python resizes hash table when load factor > .66
            - After resizing, all items in old hash table have to be added to new one O(n)
        - Nice property of chaining method is its easy implementation
            - Drawback -> requires auxiliary data structure - list to hold items with colliding keys
            - For applications where space is an issue (like hand-held devices)
                - We can consider storing each item in a separate table slot
                - Load factor is always at most required to be 1
                - Dealing with "collisions" becomes more complicated
    - Collision-Handling Schemes Open Addressing
        - Linear Probing
            - Inserting an element (k, v) at M[j]
                - j is the index generated by hash fucntion
            - If jth slot i

            - Dictionaries
            - Key must always be unique
        - Maps use an array-like syntax for indexing
            - Currency[ Greece ] tp access a value (currency) associated with key
            - Can be updated Currency[ Greece ] = new (updates value for greece) or creates new
        - Indices don't need to be consecutive or numeric
        - Applications
            - User data, map DNS hostname, 
    - Map ADT
        - get(k) method -> returns value associated with key, k, or error if not present
        - put(k, v) method
        - remove(k)

    - Hast Tables
        - The most practical data structure to implement "map"
        - Used python's dict class implementation
        - Key -> Hash function -> Indices/code (hash codes)
        - The goal of hash function,h, is to map each key, k, to an integer in the range [0, N-1]
        - Many different strategies to generate hash code
            - Take ASCII value of all characters in a strong and calculate sum of them
                - "Tim" has ASCII value of 84 + 105 + 109 = 298
                - Store in N = 11 memory locations
                    - Take modulo with size M -> 298 % 11 -> 1

Recursion

FunctionCall Stack

Dynamic Programming: Refers to an optimization over plain recursion
    - Avoid making a function call again which has already been executed by:
        - storing the intermediate solution of subproblems and use them later when needed
        - this is called Memoization

Two approaches of formulating a dynamic programming solution:
    1) Top-down approach: Use memoization
        - Create the fib sequence function
        - Create variable which will hold the returning value
            - Apppend variable to list if not already there
        - Repeat
    2) Bottom up approach using tabulation (iterative) method

Longest common subsequence: Problem of finding a longest subsequence 't' in a given set of
sequences (usually just two) S1 and S2, such that all characters in 't' appears in S1 and S2
in the same order
    - Example:
        S1: a. b. c. d
        S2: a. b, c, a, d
        longest common:  abc, abd
        2**n possible subsequences
    - Optimizing
        Compare if the last in each sequence are the same
