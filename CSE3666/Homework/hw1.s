"Question 2: Write RISC-V instructions to reverse the order of bytes in register s2 
and save the results ins4. For example, if s2 is 0x12345678, the four bytes in s2 
are 0x12, 0x34, 0x56, and 0x78.Register s4 should be 0x78563412 after the execution 
of the instruction sequence. Usetemporary registers like t0 and t1 to save 
intermediate values."

"Question 3a -> s0 = 0xFF00FF00"

main:
    addi s1, x0, 0 # s1 = 0
    addi t0, x0, 1 # Use t0 as a mask to test each bit in s0
loop:
    and t1, s0, t0 # extract bit with a mask
    beq t1, x0, skip # if the bit is 0, do not increment s1
    addi s1, s1, 1 # increment the counter
skip:
    slli t0, t0, 1 # shift the mask to left by 1
    bne t0, x0, loop # if the mask is not 0, continue

Initial values
s0 = 1111 1111 0000 0000 1111 1111 0000 0000
t0 = 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001

Initial instructions - 2.

The and / beq / slli / bne instructions execute for every bit in s0, thus 
32*4 = 128. The addi instruction will only execute for the 1 
bits in s0, thus 128 + 16 = 144. Adding the initial instructions
gives us a total value of 146 instructions. 

The location of the 1 bits do not matter, but the number of executed instructions
(at least for the addi instruction) does matter as addi will only run when the bit
is equal to 1.

# s0 = 1111 1111 0000 0000 1111 1111 0000 0000
1. check if MSB = 1
2. if 1, increase counter and decrement loop
3. if 0, just decrement loop
4. continue 32 times

main:
    addi s1, x0, 0 # counter
    add t0, s0, x0 # make a copy so s0 is not changed
    addi t1, x0, 32 # count down from 32 

loop: 
    blt t0, x0, counter # if MSB = 1, goto counter
    beq x0, x0, decrement # else, goto decrement

counter:
    addi s1, s1, 1 # increment counter

decrement:
    srai t0, t0, 1 # right shift to next MSB
    addi t1, t1, -1 # decrement loop counter
    bne t1, x0, loop # jump to loop 32 times

Initial instructions - 3.

Inside loop:
    blt / beq instructions will only run 32 times in total. 

Inside counter:
    addi instruction only runs when MSB = 1, thus 16 times.

Inside decrement: 
    srai / addi / bne / instructions each run 32 times, thus 32 * 3 = 96.

Total - 96 + 32 + 16 + 3 = 147 instructions.
