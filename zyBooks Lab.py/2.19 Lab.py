"""goal: find amounts of stuff for given number fo servings, convert to gallons

high level structure:
get reference servings and quantities
get desired servings
compute desired quantities
print desired quantities
print conversion to gallons

pseudocode:
read in lemon juice
read in water
read in agave
read in servings

print out everything

read in desired servings

compute needed quantities (= reference * ratio of reference to desired)
print desired quantities

print desired / 16"""
